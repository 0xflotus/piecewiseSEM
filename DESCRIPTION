Description: Implements piecewise structural equation modeling from a single
    list of structural equations, with new methods for non-linear, latent, and
    composite variables, standardized coefficients, query-based prediction and
    indirect effects. See <http://jslefche.github.io/piecewiseSEM/> for more.
