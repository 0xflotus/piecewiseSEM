## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Imported suggested methods in NAMESPACE, and added 'methods' to imports field in DESCRIPTION

* Reduced the run times for some functions; other functions cannot be reduced in order to maintain consistent output with published data source

* Re-ran win_build() checks (passed)

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.2
* win-builder (R-devel and R-release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
