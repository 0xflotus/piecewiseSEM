## Update package
This is a bug fix update.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

## NOTES 
* Several examples take longer >5 s to run on the test system but are crucial for reproducing the analyses in the primary literature. I have commented out several of the examples in an effort to reduce the run time

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.5
* win-builder (R-devel and R-release)
